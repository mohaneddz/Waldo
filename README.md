    Waldo Finder! 🌟
</h1>
Waldo Solver is a fast, privacy-first, AI-powered desktop app that helps you find Waldo in images using advanced computer vision models. Built for speed, simplicity, and local intelligence.

> Runtime update: the app now uses a TypeScript inference pipeline instead of the old Python server, so users no longer need to bundle Python or manage extra runtime dependencies.

## Core Features ⚡

* 🖼️ **AI-Powered Waldo Detection:**  
    Uses local computer vision models to find Waldo in your images.

* 🔍 **Offline Processing:**  
    All detection runs locally. No internet required, no data leaves your device.

* 📂 **SUPER FREAKING FAST:**  
    Select and process your images at the speed of light, with live progress tracking.

* 📂 **Multi Objects classification:**  
    Can differentiate between Waldo and all of his friends and family! ( I assume they are, is there a lore to this?)

* 🎨 **Modern UI:**  
    Responsive, clean interface built with SolidJS and TailwindCSS.

* 💻 **Cross-platform Desktop App:**  
    Powered by Tauri for lightweight, native performance on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Models Used 🧠

> All models run **locally** and are optimized for performance.

| Model        | Purpose                      | Notes |
|--------------|-----------------------------|-------|
| **YOLOv12**   | Object detection (Waldo)    | Fast, accurate, runs locally |
| **Custom Waldo Dataset** | Trained for Waldos detection | Improves accuracy on challenge images |

- The training wasn't straightforward, as you can see you can't just train a model on these beefy huge images, so I had to be ... creative :^)
